This is a directory for running NCS. The initialization files have
been generated from running towards netsim project defined
in /Users/hniska/stash.tail-f.com/external-id-allocation/test/ncs/netsim

The directory content in . has been generated through
the invocation of

# /Users/hniska/ncs-release/4.3.1/bin/ncs-setup --package cisco-ios --dest .

The devices in that netsim directory are

c0 CLI/10022


- To start the emulated network, go there and do ncs-netsim start | help
  If the netsim directory for the emulated network resides above here
  the ncs-netsim command will search upwards in the directory
  hierarchy to search for the netsim directory.

- To start NCS, do

    # ncs  [--verbose --foreground]

- To stop NCS, do

    # ncs --stop

- To get a regular CLI into NCS, do

    # ncs_cli -u admin

- To restart NCS from scratch,

   # ncs-setup --reset

    this will ensure NCS is reinitialized from the ncs-cdb/*.xml files
    when restarted

- To restart the netsim network from scratch, do

    # ncs-netsim stop
    # ncs-netsim reset
    # ncs-netsim start

        or in one swoop

    # ncs-netsim restart
